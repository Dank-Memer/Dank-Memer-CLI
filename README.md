# Dank Memer CLI (copypasta)
Ever wanted to see a random "copypasta" in your command line? Well now you can!

Binaries are in /builds for you to use!

## TODO

- [x] Ignore texts that are images and don't have the "selftext" field
- [x] The random number should probably take the above into account and not choose between 100, but rather how many text posts there are.
